# K2_Recursion

The project explores the differences in performance for iterative and recursive algorithms for calculating factorials and for generating terms in the Fibonacci series. It consists of a Jupyter notebook that was used to interactively develop code, several .py scripts that implement the same code, and outputs line graphs comparing calculation times.
