# K2_Recursion

The project explores the differences in performance for iterative and recursive algorithms for calculating factorials and for generating terms in the Fibonacci series. It consists of a Jupyter notebook that was used to interactively develop code. In /src there is a script (algoritms_working.py) that also calls a module (algorithms_functions), that implement the notebook code, and outputs line graphs comparing calculation times.
